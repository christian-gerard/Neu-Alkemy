[SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT]

## Project Structure

- `packages/` - Contains all workspace packages (functions, core, web, etc.)
- `infra/` - Infrastructure definitions split by service (storage.ts, api.ts, web.ts)
- `sst.config.ts` - Main SST configuration with dynamic imports

## Code Standards

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Shared code goes in `packages/core/` with proper exports configuration
- Functions go in `packages/functions/`
- Infrastructure should be split into logical files in `infra/`
